    "# Non-AI Version: The computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess the number within a certain number of attempts.\n",
    "# AI Version: The AI will attempt to guess the player's chosen number using strategies (like binary search).\n",

    "# In this version, the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess the number. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The player wins if they guess the correct number within 10 attempts."
