    "### **Explanation of Both Versions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-AI Version:** The player guesses the number while the computer provides feedback. Itâ€™s a simple interaction where the player uses logic to adjust their guesses based on whether the guess is too high or too low.\n",
    "- **AI Version:** The computer plays the guessing game using a binary search strategy to guess the player's number. Binary search is an efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides the search range in half.\n",
    "- **BFS Version:** BFS maintains a queue of potential guesses, starting from the lowest value in the range. It systematically eliminates numbers that are too high or too low based on feedback.\n",
    "- **DFS Version:** DFS uses a stack to explore potential numbers. It guesses a number and pops the stack, removing numbers that are either too high or too low.\n",
    "- **Simulated Annealing:**\n",
    "The AI randomly guesses a number.\n",
    "It calculates a neighboring guess by randomly moving within a defined range around the current guess.\n",
    "The algorithm accepts better guesses and occasionally worse guesses to escape local optima, but over time it becomes more conservative (i.e., it \"cools down\").\n",
    "The process continues until the AI finds the correct number or the temperature (exploration level) becomes too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you five versions of a basic guessing game, one without AI (player guesses) and four with AI (AI guesses using binary search)."
